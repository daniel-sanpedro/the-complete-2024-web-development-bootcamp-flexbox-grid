# FLEXBOX and GRID

## Description

    Flexbox
    The flexible box layout module, usually referred to as flexbox,
    was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method
    that could offer space distribution between items in an interface
    and powerful alignment capabilities. This article gives an
    outline of the main features of flexbox, which we will be exploring
    in more detail in the rest of these guides.

    Grid
    The CSS grid layout module excels at dividing a page into
    major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size,
    position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.
